# IoT Project by Group 4

- The code is distributed in the following python notebooks:
  - SVMFirePrediction.ipynb - used for training and inference of forest fire prediction model
  - cnn.ipynb - used for chainsaw audio conversion to mel spectrograms and training of CNN model on it
  - getStronglyLabelledData.ipynb - used to download and save audio samples as mp3
  - cnnPredict.ipynb - used for chainsaw audio detection inference
- data directory includes the datasets for both forest fire prediction and chainsaw detection
  - link for dataset - https://www.dropbox.com/s/p15re1za22b4yzl/IoTProjectData.zip?dl=0
  - the downloaded zip needs to be extracted in the same directory as the code so that the directory structure looks like below:
    - cnn.ipynb
    - cnnPredict.ipynb
    - getStronglyLabelledData.ipynb
    - SVMFirePrediction.ipynb
    - data/
